# 6. RECTANGLE OVERLAP

# Write a method (overlap) which takes two (rectangles) defined by the coordinates of their corners, and determines whether they overlap
#You can assume all coordinates are positive integers.


def overlap(rect1, rect2)
  if #insert argument here
    return true

  else
    return false
